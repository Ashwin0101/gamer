# Gamer Hub - Login Frontend (React + Vite)

A small, stylish login page for gamer projects. This frontend is built with React and Vite and is ready to deploy on Vercel.

## How to run locally
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Push to GitHub.
2. Import repo in Vercel and deploy. Vercel detects Vite apps automatically.

## Connect to backend
Currently the login action calls `/api/login`. Update `Login.jsx` to point to your backend (for example `https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/login`).
